Four topics (three with tutorials):

* Labour demand (10th August);
* Firm size and wages; earnings equations with firm characteristics (17th and 18th August);
* Job search and matching; machine learning (24th and 25th August);
* Active labour market policies (ALMPS); evaluating these with DiDs and RCTs (5th and 6th October).

Each of these will have a separate folder.
